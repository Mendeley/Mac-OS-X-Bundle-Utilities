update-mac-bundle-lib-names.rb is a script to replace
references to libraries in binaries in a Mac OS X bundle to refer
to copies of the libraries in the bundle instead of system-wide locations.

It was originally written for use with a Qt application to ensure that the application
in the bundle used the copies of the Qt libraries instead of copies installed to
system-wide locations.

See update-mac-bundle-lib-names.rb for more details and usage.
